# EPGP Classic

EPGP-Classic **CAN** work on **WOW Classic**.

## Relationship with "epgp (dkp reloaded)"

This project is a fork of the [EPGP Next](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/epgp-next) addon, which was a fork of [epgp (dkp reloaded)](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/epgp-dkp-reloaded) and **NOT** working on **WOW Classic**.

Special thanks to all the previous authors who got us this far. Uninstall (delete) or disable ANY other EPGP addons before using this one.
